# N-Queens Problem - Advanced Chess Configurations Exam

## Part 1: Classic N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens puzzle requires placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. A queen can attack pieces on the same row, column, or diagonal.
For this exam, you need to create a program that:

Takes an integer N as input
Returns ALL distinct solutions to the N-queens puzzle
Represents the solutions using 'O' for empty squares and '#' for queens

---

Example:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: [
  [
    "O#OO",
    "OOO#",
    "#OOO",
    "OO#O"
  ],
  [
    "OO#O",
    "#OOO",
    "OOO#",
    "O#OO"
  ]
]
```

## Part 2: Single-Attack Queens Configuration

Problem Description
Find all possible configurations where each queen attacks exactly one other queen on an 4×4 board. A configuration is valid if:

Each queen attacks exactly one other queen
Each queen is attacked by exactly one other queen
Queens can attack along rows, columns, or diagonals

Here you don't need to find N queen

Example for N = 5:

```
[
  [
    "OOO#O",
    "OOOO#",
    "#OOOO",
    "OOOOO",
    "#OOOO"
  ]
]
```
